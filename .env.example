# === Database Configuration ===
# This application can be configured to use different database backends.
# SQLite is recommended for simple local development and some production scenarios.
# PostgreSQL is a more robust option for larger applications.

# --- Option 1: PostgreSQL (Commented out by default) ---
# Ensure you have the 'psycopg2-binary' package installed if you use PostgreSQL:
# pip install psycopg2-binary
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://your_db_user:your_db_password@your_db_host:5432/your_db_name

# --- Option 2: SQLite (Default and recommended for easy setup) ---
# This will create a database file named 'app.db' in the project's root directory.
# For production, ensure this file is persisted and backed up.
# For development, 'test.db' is also a common name (e.g., if tests use a separate DB).
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db


# === JWT / Security Configuration ===
# IMPORTANT: Generate a strong, unique secret key for your actual .env file.
# This key is crucial for securing your application's authentication tokens.
# You can generate a suitable key using: openssl rand -hex 32
SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key_please_change_me

# Algorithm used for JWT signing. HS256 is a common choice.
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256

# Lifetime of access tokens in minutes.
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60

# Lifetime of refresh tokens in days.
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=30


# === Application Environment & Debugging ===
# Set the application environment. Options: development, production, testing.
# This can be used by the application to enable/disable certain features.
ENV=development

# Toggle FastAPI debug mode. Set to False in production for security and performance.
DEBUG=True


# === CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) ===
# Define which frontend origins are allowed to communicate with the API.
# This is a comma-separated string of URLs.
# Example for a local frontend on port 3000 and your production domain:
# ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000,https://your.frontend.domain.com"
# For a very permissive local development setup (use with caution):
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8000,http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://127.0.0.1:8000"


# === First Superuser Configuration ===
# These are used by the initial_data.py script to create a superuser if one doesn't exist.
FIRST_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=admin
FIRST_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=admin@example.com
FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=adminpassword # Please change this in your actual .env file


# Add any other application-specific environment variables below as needed.
