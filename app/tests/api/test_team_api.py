# Notes on improvements:
# - `test_create_team_duplicate_name`: Ensure the expected status code (400 or 409) and error message.
# - `test_update_team_not_found`: Changed to 404 as per common REST.
# - `test_list_teams_include_deleted`: Added cleanup by restoring the team.
# - `test_restore_team_not_deleted_error`: Added logic to ensure team is not deleted.
# - `test_hard_delete_team_success_superuser`: Added comment about fixture state.
# - `test_hard_delete_team_forbidden_normal_user`: Made more robust by creating and cleaning up its own team.
# - `other_user_token_headers` fixture is assumed to exist from conftest.py.
# - UUID for team names in fixture helps avoid collisions if tests run in parallel or re-run.
# - Using HTTPStatus enum for status codes.
# - Added `db.refresh()` in tests that modify and then check DB state of a SQLAlchemy model.
# - For `test_restore_team_not_deleted_error`, getting a fresh session for `db_team` using `Session.object_session(test_team_by_user)`
#   and then `db_team = crud_get_team(db=Session.object_session(test_team_by_user), team_id=test_team_by_user.id)` is more robust.
# - The cleanup for `test_hard_delete_team_forbidden_normal_user` uses `pytest.lazy_fixture` to get superuser_token_headers.
#   This is a good pattern if the fixture is complex or might not be available otherwise.
# - `crud_create_team` in fixture: `team_in_dict` should match what `crud_create_team` expects.
#   The prompt example `crud_create_team(db, {**team_data.model_dump(), "owner_id": test_user.id})` implies it takes a dict.
#   My fixture uses `team_in_dict = {"name": team_name, "description": "Test team description", "owner_id": test_user.id}`
#   and passes `team_in=team_in_dict`. This should be consistent.
# - Added `pytest.lazy_fixture` for `superuser_token_headers` in the cleanup of `test_hard_delete_team_forbidden_normal_user`.
# - Corrected `test_restore_team_not_deleted_error` to use `Session.object_session(test_team_by_user)` to get the session for the team object.
# - Made sure `test_list_teams_include_deleted` restores the team at the end.
# - Made sure `test_soft_delete_team_success_owner` restores the team at the end.
# - Made sure `test_restore_team_forbidden_non_owner` restores the team at the end if it was deleted by owner.
# - The `test_hard_delete_team_success_superuser` test deletes the shared `test_team_by_user`. This will affect subsequent tests using this fixture.
#   A better approach would be for this test to create its own unique team, delete it, and verify.
#   I will modify this test to create its own team.

# Final pass on test_hard_delete_team_success_superuser:
# This test should create a NEW team, then delete it, to avoid affecting other tests that rely on test_team_by_user.
# I'll adjust it.
# Also, the normal_user_token_headers in test_hard_delete_team_forbidden_normal_user's cleanup should be superuser.
# And in test_restore_team_forbidden_non_owner, the final restore should also use normal_user_token_headers.
# Ok, the cleanup in hard_delete_forbidden already uses lazy_fixture for SU.
# The restore in restore_forbidden also seems fine.
# The main issue is hard_delete_success_superuser deleting the shared fixture.
# I will modify test_hard_delete_team_success_superuser to create its own team.
